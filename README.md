# Welcome to Data-Science-projects repository 👋🏻

This repository is the portfolio for keeping Pasit's Data science projects.

There are two main directories have been kept.

## 1. Deep learning directory 
**Deep learning** directory keeps projects that relevant in applying Deep learning or Neural network technioques to solve the problems. <br> <br>
- 📖 **RNN_LSTM directory**, apply RNN and LSTM architectures to build the story generator AI. <br>
- 🌃 **image colorization directory**, apply CNN architecture and transfer learning model, InceptionResnetV2, to build colorization AI. <br>
- 🐶 **CNN.ipynb**, apply CNN architecture to build cat/dog classification AI. <br>
- 5️⃣ **Deep Neural Network.ipynb**, apply traditional Neural network to build MNIST dataset number classification AI. <br>
- 🏦 **Neural Network.ipynb**, apply Deep neural network to predict whether clients subscribe the term deposit using bank.csv dataset. <br>
- 👻 **VAE.ipynb**, apply Variational autoencoders to create latent matrix for input feature.  <br>

## 2. Machine learning directory 
**Machine learning** directory keeps projects that relevant in applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning to solve the problems. <br> <br>
- 💰 **DecisionTree.ipynb**, apply decision tree model to predict whether clients subscribe the term deposit using bank.csv dataset. <br>
- 🚗 **Kmeans.ipynb**, apply Kmeans and Hierarchical clustering to cluster the cars from mtcars.csv dataset. <br>
- 🚙 **LinearRegression.ipynb**, apply Linear regression to predict miles per gallon of cars using mtcars.csv dataset. <br>
- 💵 **LogisticRegression.ipynb**, apply Logistic regression to predict whether clients subscribe the term deposit using bank.csv dataset. <br>
