# Welcome to my Data-Science-projects repository 👋🏻

This repository is a portfolio for keeping Pasit's Data science projects. Projects in this repository consist of exercises from university course and self developed projects. 

There are two main directories have been kept.

## 1. Deep learning directory 
**Deep learning** directory keeps projects that relevant in applying Deep learning or Neural network technioques to solve the problems. 
- 📖 **story generator directory**, apply RNN and LSTM architectures to build the story generator AI. 
- 🌃 **image colorization directory**, apply CNN architecture and transfer learning model, InceptionResnetV2, to build colorization AI. 
- 🐶 **cat_or_dog.ipynb**, apply CNN architecture to build cat/dog classification AI. 
- 5️⃣ **predict_MNIST.ipynb**, apply traditional Neural network to build MNIST dataset number classification AI. 
- 🏦 **bank_nn.ipynb**, apply Deep neural network to predict whether clients subscribe the term deposit using bank.csv dataset. 
- 👻 **VAE.ipynb**, apply Variational autoencoders to create latent matrix for input feature.  

## 2. Machine learning directory 
**Machine learning** directory keeps projects that relevant in applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning to solve the problems. 
- 💰 **bank_dt.ipynb**, apply decision tree model to predict whether clients subscribe the term deposit using bank.csv dataset. 
- 🏨 **hotel_cancellation.ipynb**, apply classification algorithms to predict whether customers will cancel the hotel reservation.
- 🚗 **cars_clustering.ipynb**, apply Kmeans and Hierarchical clustering to cluster the cars from mtcars.csv dataset. 
- 💸 **bank_knn.ipynb**, apply KNN to predict whether clients subscribe the term deposit using bank.csv dataset. 
- 🚙 **cars_lnr.ipynb**, apply Linear regression to predict miles per gallon of cars using mtcars.csv dataset. 
- 💵 **LogisticRegression.ipynb**, apply Logistic regression to predict whether clients subscribe the term deposit using bank.csv dataset.
